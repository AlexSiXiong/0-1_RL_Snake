# RL_Snake
In this project, I will implement a reinforcement learning snake from scratch.

I won't refer any existing solution online.
 
Code will be refactored later. Building something that works is the priority.

# Progress
1. running snake. 
   - press up down left right, the snake moves
   - the snake eats food
   - the snake will die if it hits the border
